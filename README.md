# Project Documentation

## API Integration
We use `axios` for API calls in this project. Below is the guide to set up and use API calls effectively:

### Basic API Configuration
- The core API setup is located in the `services` folder, specifically in the `index.js` file.
- You can directly use predefined methods (`get`, `post`, `put`, `postFormData`) in your pages by importing them.

### How to Make API Calls
1. **GET Request:**
   ```javascript
   import { get } from 'path_to_services';
   
   get('your_url')
       .then((res) => {
           // Handle success
       })
       .catch((e) => {
           // Handle error
       });
   ```

2. **POST Request:**
   ```javascript
   import { post } from 'path_to_services';
   
   post('your_url', payload)
       .then((res) => {
           // Handle success
       })
       .catch((e) => {
           // Handle error
       });
   ```

**Note:**
- Do not include the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) in `your_url`.
- Use only the sub-URL (e.g., `/get/personal-info`). The base URL will automatically be appended from the `BaseUrl.js` file.

### Base URL Management
- Base URLs are defined in the `BaseUrl.js` file.
- If modifications are required, duplicate the file, make your changes, and comment out the original for reference.

## Page and Component Creation

### Creating Pages
- Navigate to the `pages` folder.
- If a folder for your page already exists, use it; otherwise, create a new folder with a relevant name.
- Inside this folder, create the necessary files for your page.

### Creating Components
- Navigate to the `components` folder.
- If a folder for your component already exists, use it; otherwise, create a new folder with a relevant name.

## Theme and Styling
- The project theme is located in the `theme` folder.
- **Color Palette:**
  - Primary: Blue
  - Secondary: Orange
- Always use the theme palette for colors to maintain consistency.

## Image Management
- Use the `public` folder for storing images.
- Inside the `public` folder, navigate to the `assets/images` folder.
- Create a sub-folder with a relevant name for your image files.

## Form Validation
- Form validation schemas are located in the `utils/validations` folder.
- Create new validation schemas if required or use existing ones wherever possible.
